\title{Generate the full dataset underlying the scarcentral database}
\usage{
scarcentral()
}
\value{
A list of \code{process} objects, each representing a tumorigenic process
and its associated multiomic \code{scars}
}
\description{
This function constructs and returns a dataset that represents the complete set
of tumorigenic processes and their associated scars for the scarcentral database.
The dataset is structured as a list of \code{process} objects, each of which contains a list of
\code{scar} objects linked to the process. The scars include details such as the tumorigenic process
that generates them, associated diseases, biological modalities, specificity, and sensitivity metrics.
}
\details{
The scarcentral database is designed to provide a comprehensive resource on mutation signatures
or scars left by different tumorigenic processes (e.g., radiation therapy). It includes metadata such as
research experiments that identified the scars, the biological significance of each scar,
and links to related publications and tools.

# Generate the full scarcentral dataset
dataset <- scarcentral()

# Access the first process in the dataset
process_1 <- dataset[[1]]

# View the scars associated with the first process
